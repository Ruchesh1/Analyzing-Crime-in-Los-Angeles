# Analyzing-Crime-in-Los-Angeles
Project Description
Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind!

In this project, you'll serve as a data detective, supporting the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime data to guide how they should allocate resources to protect the people of their city!

Explore the crimes.csv dataset and use your findings to answer the following questions:

Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes? Store as an integer variable called peak_crime_hour.
Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)? Save as a string variable called peak_night_crime_location.
Identify the number of crimes committed against victims by age group (0-17, 18-25, 26-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+). Save as a pandas Series called victim_ages.
